# Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers at distinct indices in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
# Return the sum of the three integers.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
